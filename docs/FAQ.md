## SECTION A — Purpose & Positioning

### A1. What is Shunyaya Infinity Algebra, in simple terms?

SIA is a **deterministic algebra** that decides whether an operation involving infinity is **structurally justified**.

Classical mathematics tells us what to do *after* infinity is approximated.  
SIA asks a prior question:

> “Is this infinity operation allowed to mean anything at all?”

- If yes → SIA proceeds lawfully  
- If not → SIA refuses explicitly  

---

### A2. Why is SIA needed if classical mathematics already handles infinity?

Classical mathematics handles infinity through:

- limits  
- asymptotics  
- approximation  

But it has **no admissibility layer**.

As a result, expressions like:

- `INF - INF`  
- `INF / INF`  
- `0 × INF`  

are either:

- approximated silently, or  
- declared “indeterminate” without explanation  

SIA fills this gap by making **structural justification explicit**.

---

### A3. Does SIA replace limits, analysis, or numerical methods?

No.

- Limits remain correct  
- Analysis remains correct  
- Numerical methods remain correct  

SIA **precedes** them.

SIA decides whether a symbolic infinity manipulation is justified **before** approximation begins.

---

### A4. Is SIA speculative or philosophical?

No.

SIA is:

- fully deterministic  
- executable  
- reproducible  
- phase-verified  
- audit-sealed  

Every claim is backed by:

- executable tests  
- refusal invariants  
- monotonicity checks  
- cryptographic audit trails  

There is **no reliance on interpretation**.

---

## SECTION B — How SIA Works

### B1. What exactly does SIA evaluate?

SIA evaluates **structural admissibility**, not numeric value.

It determines whether an operation involving infinity:

- is justified by declared structure, or  
- must be refused  

---

### B2. What does “structural admissibility” mean in SIA?

It means:

> “Given the declared structure of the infinities involved, is this operation lawful?”

It is **not** about:

- magnitude  
- convergence  
- rate  
- approximation quality  

It is about **justification**.

---

### B3. Why does SIA refuse instead of approximating?

Because approximation without justification **fabricates certainty**.

SIA enforces a strict rule:

- If structure is insufficient → `ABSTAIN`

Approximation may follow — **but explicitly, outside SIA**.

---

### B4. What are ALLOW / ABSTAIN / RESOLVE?

These are admissibility outcomes:

- **ALLOW** — operation is structurally justified  
- **ABSTAIN** — structure is insufficient to proceed  
- **RESOLVE** — a refusal becomes lawful only under strict conditions  

`ABSTAIN` is intentional and dominant.  
It is **not indecision**.  
It is refusal to fabricate meaning.

---

## SECTION C — Infinity, Not Approximation

### C1. How is SIA different from limits or asymptotics?

Limits answer:

> “What value does this approach?”

SIA answers:

> “Is this symbolic infinity operation justified at all?”

They operate at **different layers**.

---

### C2. Can an expression be classically meaningful but still ABSTAIN in SIA?

Yes.

SIA may `ABSTAIN` even when:

- a limit exists, or  
- an approximation is well-behaved  

This is intentional.

SIA does **not** judge usefulness.  
It judges **justification**.

---

### C3. Does ABSTAIN mean the expression is meaningless?

No.

It means:

> “Meaning is not justified without additional structure.”

`ABSTAIN` preserves honesty.

---

### C4. Does SIA ever block expressions that other symbolic systems allow?

Yes — intentionally.

Many symbolic systems allow expressions like:

`(INF - INF) / INF`

to propagate, hoping later context resolves them.

SIA refuses early.

If subtraction lacks structural identity, SIA returns `ABSTAIN`.  
Downstream operations are then blocked.

Classical limits or approximations may still be applied explicitly afterward —  
but SIA does not allow unjustified symbolic steps to proceed silently.

---

## SECTION D — The Infinity Object

### D1. What is the SIA infinity object (Omega)?

SIA represents infinity as:

`Omega = < sign, posture, kind, witness >`

Where:

- `sign` — `+INF` or `-INF`  
- `posture` — internal alignment lane  
- `kind` — semantic regime (`dual`, `growth`, `osc`, `sat`)  
- `witness` — provenance of divergence  

---

### D2. Why does SIA require kind and witness?

Because cancellation without semantics is unsafe.

- `kind` prevents semantic mismatch  
- `witness` prevents provenance leakage  

Without them, cancellation is refused.

---

### D3. Why is mixed-sign division forbidden?

Because no lawful structure exists to justify it.

SIA refuses rather than inventing rules.

---

## SECTION E — Determinism & Verification

### E1. Why is SIA implemented as a single executable script?

To guarantee:

- determinism  
- total ordering of decisions  
- auditable certificate chains  
- irreversible finality  

Multiple scripts would weaken proof integrity.

---

### E2. What do Phases 1–5 establish?

They establish:

- lawful same-sign operations  
- honest mixed-sign refusal  
- controlled `RESOLVE` behavior  
- non-collapse of infinity  
- refusal stability under regrouping  

---

### E3. Why are refusal and non-collapse tested explicitly?

Because permissive systems fail silently.

SIA proves not only what is allowed,  
but what **cannot** be coerced.

---

## SECTION F — Certification, Finality & Auditability

### F1. What is Proof-Assistant Mode (Phase 6C)?

It is a certification layer where every decision emits:

- a structured predicate check  
- an `ALLOW` or `ABSTAIN` outcome  
- a deterministic certificate hash  

---

### F2. Why does SIA generate certificates and hashes?

To make reasoning:

- tamper-evident  
- replayable  
- machine-verifiable  

Trust is established by **recomputation**, not authority.

---

### F3. What does “finality” mean in SIA?

Finality means:

- certificate issuance ends  
- the proof chain is sealed  
- no further mutation is possible  

After sealing, SIA becomes **read-only mathematics**.

---

## SECTION G — Usage, Safety & Scope

### G1. Is SIA a computer algebra system (CAS)?

No.

SIA does **not** simplify expressions.  
It judges admissibility of simplification.

---

### G2. Is SIA safe for production or automated reasoning?

SIA is safe as a **gate**.

It should not be used to:

- auto-approximate  
- auto-simplify  
- auto-optimize  

It exists to **refuse unjustified steps**.

---

### G3. What kinds of use are appropriate?

Appropriate use includes:

- foundational mathematics  
- symbolic safety layers  
- proof assistants  
- CAS guardrails  
- AI reasoning integrity  

---

## SECTION H — The Bigger Picture

### H1. Is SIA standalone or part of a larger framework?

Both.

SIA is standalone,  
and foundational within the Shunyaya ecosystem:

- SSIT  
- SSNT  
- SSD  
- SSTS  

None bypass SIA.

---

### H2. Why is SIA considered foundational?

Because it governs **infinite admissibility** —  
a prerequisite for higher symbolic systems.

---

### H3. What is the long-term significance?

SIA enables:

- honest infinity reasoning  
- refusal-aware mathematics  
- safer symbolic systems  
- explicit approximation boundaries  

It restores **restraint where power once dominated**.

---

## ONE-LINE SUMMARY

**Shunyaya Infinity Algebra makes infinity operations lawful only when structure exists —  
and refuses honestly when it does not.**
