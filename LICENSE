Research and Usage Notice

Shunyaya Infinity Algebra (SIA) is a foundational, deterministic, structure-based algebra that governs admissibility of operations involving infinity, without modifying:

finite arithmetic

limits

asymptotics

or classical mathematical results

SIA evaluates structural admissibility, not numeric value.

It refuses unjustified operations explicitly, rather than fabricating meaning through approximation or closure.

SIA is intended for:

foundational mathematical research

symbolic reasoning and representation studies

formal verification and proof integrity research

refusal-aware computation

academic and educational use

SIA is not:

a computer algebra system (CAS)

a limit or asymptotics engine

a numerical approximation method

a symbolic simplifier or optimizer

a semantic inference engine

a decision-making or control system

All classical mathematics remains valid and unchanged.
SIA acts prior to approximation, not in place of it.

Integrity and Verification

Mathematical integrity in SIA is enforced by:

explicit structural admissibility rules

dominant refusal semantics (ABSTAIN)

determinism and reproducibility

auditability and finality discipline

Integrity is structural and verifiable, not dependent on licensing restrictions.

Independent implementations may exist.
Only structurally correct executions preserve SIA invariants.

Relationship to Other Licenses

This license applies to:

the SIA specification

documentation

conceptual and explanatory materials

Executable implementations, verification tools, certification artifacts, and derived systems may be released under CC BY 4.0 or Open Standards, provided such licensing is explicitly stated.

No implicit relicensing is granted.

Responsibility

Any use of SIA in automated reasoning, governance, safety-critical, or decision-making contexts is undertaken entirely at the user’s own responsibility.

SIA provides admissibility discipline, not authority or guarantees.
